        <h2>outdoor habitat.</h2>
        <p style="line-height:150%">Sthiti holds the belief that forming a strong connection to nature is key to leading a healthy lifestyle. Yoga classes are therefore held outdoors set on a mountain top. Practicing outside allows you to be completely free of distractions and focus on aligning your mind with nature. The peaceful environment gives you the opportunity to disconnect from the heavily-connected world and notice your natural surroundings. Beside the daily spectacular view of the sunrise and sunset from the mountain top, there also lies the added benefit of soaking up plenty of vitamin D naturally. These practices will awaken your senses and give you the ability to apply these throughout your day, training you to be present in all aspects of your life.
